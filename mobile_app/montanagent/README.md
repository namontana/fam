## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.19 or later)
- Firebase project with the following services enabled:

  - Firestore Database
  - Hosting (for web deployment)
- Google AI API key for Gemini

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Setup Flutter

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd mobile_app/montanagent
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Firebase Configuration

1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Enable Authentication with Email/Password and Anonymous sign-in
3. Enable Firestore Database
4. Enable Hosting (for web deployment)

#### Using FlutterFire CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install FlutterFire CLI
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

# Configure Firebase for your project
flutterfire configure
```

#### Manual Configuration
If FlutterFire CLI doesn't work, manually update `lib/firebase_options.dart` with your Firebase project configuration.

### 3. Gemini AI Setup

1. Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Update `lib/main.dart` and replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key

**⚠️ Security Note**: In production, store the API key securely using environment variables or Firebase Remote Config.

### 4. Firestore Security Rules

Deploy the included Firestore rules:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```
